# Space Bar

## This e-commerce site was originally designed to allow users to buy mechanical keyboards. Using XHRs and Ajaxing to pull in data from a MySQL database, users could register, login, and change a few of their settings (like their email or password). The site was never really completed or anything, so it's here mainly for archiving purposes.
